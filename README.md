# Brain Tumor Prediction

## üöÄ Project Overview
This project leverages advanced machine learning techniques to predict the presence of brain tumors from MRI scans, aiding medical professionals by providing rapid and accurate diagnostic tools to improve treatment planning and patient outcomes.

## üìä Data Description
The dataset contains MRI images categorized into four types: no tumor, glioma, meningioma, and pituitary tumor, which are preprocessed for optimal analysis.

## üîç Data Preprocessing
- **Image Resizing**: Standardized to 128x128 pixels for uniformity.
- **Grayscale Conversion**: Reduces computational complexity by converting images to grayscale.
- **Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG)**: Extracts essential edge and texture features from the images.

## üß† Models Used and Evaluation
The selection of models was guided by the need to handle diverse data characteristics effectively:

### Decision Tree Classifier
- **Why Used**: Provides a clear indication of feature importance and decision paths, which is valuable for understanding the diagnostic criteria directly from the image features.

### Random Forest Classifier
- **Why Used**: Builds on the simplicity of decision trees by creating an ensemble that can capture more complex patterns in the data, significantly reducing the risk of overfitting while improving overall accuracy.

### Support Vector Machine (SVC)
- **Why Used**: Effective in high-dimensional spaces and versatile with different kernel functions that can handle non-linear decision boundaries, which is ideal for image classification tasks like tumor detection.

### Gaussian Naive Bayes
- **Why Used**: Assumes independence between predictors. Naive Bayes was tested for its efficiency in baseline performance, especially useful when the dataset size becomes a computational challenge.

### K-Nearest Neighbors
- **Why Used**: This non-parametric method was utilized to see how well simple similarity-based prediction performs against more complex algorithms, providing a good benchmark for model complexity versus performance.

### Performance Metrics
The models were evaluated based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, with **Random Forest Classifier** emerging as the top performer due to its robustness and high accuracy in multi-class classifications like tumor types.

## üõ† Technologies Used
- **Python**: The primary programming language.
- **Scikit-Learn**: For implementing machine learning algorithms.
- **OpenCV & PIL**: For image processing tasks.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For data visualization.

## üìà Insights and Observations
- **Feature Importance**: The Random Forest model provided insights into the most crucial features for tumor detection, primarily focusing on edge and texture features.
- **Model Comparisons**: Visualizations of performance metrics helped identify the strengths and weaknesses of each model, guiding further optimizations.

## üé• Visualization and Interactive Analysis
- **Confusion Matrices**: Visual comparisons of true versus predicted labels for each model.
- **Interactive Elements**: Employed during exploratory data analysis to dynamically interact with data subsets and adjust parameters for real-time analysis.

## üìù Conclusions
The detailed analysis highlighted the superiority of the Random Forest Classifier in handling the complexity and variability of MRI image data for brain tumor prediction. Future work may explore deep learning approaches to further enhance diagnostic accuracy.
